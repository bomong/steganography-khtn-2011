"Well that is a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I wanted the adventure of it; and I'd a waded neckdeep in blood to- goodness alive, Aunt Polly!" 
If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half-full of pie, I wish I may never! 
Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles- kind of grinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says: 
"Yes, you better turn y'r head away- I would if I was you, Tom." 
"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "is he changed so? Why, that ain't Tom, it's Sid; Tom's- Tom's- why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago." 
"You mean where's Huck Finn- that's what you mean! I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years, not to know him when I see him. That would be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn." 
So I done it. But not feeling brash. 
Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest looking persons I ever see; except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in, and they told it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that give him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and trill how I was in such a tight place when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer- she chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it, now, and 'taint no need to change"- that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer, I had to stand it- there warn't no other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me. 
And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't ever understand, before, until that minute and that talk, how he could help a body set a nigger free, with his bringing-up. 
Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and Sid had come, all right and safe, she says to herself: 
"Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's up to, this time; as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it." 
"Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally. 
"Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote to you twice, to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here." 
"Well, I never got 'em, Sis." 
Aunt Polly, she turns around slow and severe, and says: 
"You, Tom!" 
"Well- what?" he says, kind of pettish. 
"Don't you what me, you impudent thing- hand out them letters." 
"What letters?" 
"Them letters. I be bound, if I have to take aholt of you I'll-" 
"They're in the trunk. There, now. And they're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into them, I hain't touched them. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd-" 
"Well, you do need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it. And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I spose he-" 
"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but it's all right, I've got that one." 
I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.
CHAPTER THE LAST 
The first time I catched Tom, private, I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion?- what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head, from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river, on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckened it was about as well the way it was.
