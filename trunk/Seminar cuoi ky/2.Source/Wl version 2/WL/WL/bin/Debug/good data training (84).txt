Well, what do you think?- that muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in then! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried to write- he see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along, till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying, himself- but pretty soon the new old gentleman broke in, and says: 
"I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?" 
"Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here." 
Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: 
"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tatooed on his breast?" 
Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden- and mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice- because how was he going to know what was tatooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, Now he'll throw up the sponge- there ain't no more use. Well, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says: 
"Mf! It's a very tough question, ain't it! Yes, sir, I k'n tell you what's tatooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue arrow- that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it. Now what do you say- hey?" 
Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek. 
The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king this time, and says: 
"There- you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks's breast?" 
Both of them spoke up and says: 
"We didn't see no such mark." 
"Good!" says the old gentleman. "Now, what you did see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P-B-W"-and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. "Come- ain't that what you saw?" 
Both of them spoke up again, and says: 
"No, we didn't. We never seen any marks at all." 
Well, everybody was in a state of mind, now; and they sings out: 
"The whole bilin' of' m's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride'em on a rail!" and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling pow-wow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says: 
"Gentlemen- gentlemen! Hear me just a word- just a single word- if you PLEASE! There's one way yet- let's go and dig up the corpse and look." 
That took them. 
"Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out: 
"Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch them along, too!" 
"We'll do it!" they all shouted: "and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang!" 
I was scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening. 
As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink, she'd light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats. 
Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wild-cats; and to make it more scary, the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time, if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tatoo-marks. If they didn't find them- 
I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist- Hines- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited; and I had to run to keep up.
