"Yes, you did- 'bout six chaws. You borry'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head." 
Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw, they don't generly cut it off with a knife, but they set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two- then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic- 
"Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug." 
All the streets and lanes was just mud, they warn't nothing else but mud- mud as black as tar, and nigh about a foot deep in some places; and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around, everywheres. You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out, and shut her eyes, and wave her ears, whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, "Hi! so boy! sick him, Tige!" and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they'd settle back again till there was a dog-fight. There couldn't anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog-fight- unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin to his tail and see him run himself to death. 
On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it. 
The nearer it got to noon that day, the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families fetched their dinners with them, from the country, and eat them in the wagons. There was considerable whiskey drinking going on, and I seen three fights. By-and-by somebody sings out- 
"Here comes old Boggs!- in from the country for his little old monthly drunk- here he comes, boys!" 
All the loafers looked glad- I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs. One of them says- 
"Wonder who he's a gwyne to chaw up this time. If he'd a chawed up all the men he's ben a gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year, he'd have considerable ruputation, now." 
Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year." 
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whopping and yelling like an Injun, and singing out- 
"Cler the track, thar. I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a gwyne to raise." 
He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him, and laughed at him, and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now, because he'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, "meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on." 
He see me, and rode up and says- 
"Whar'd you come f'm, boy? You prepared to die?" 
Then he rode on. I was scared; but a man says- "He don't mean nothing; he's always a carryin'on like that, when he's drunk. He's the best-naturedest old fool in Arkansaw- never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober." 
Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning, and yells"- 
Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled. You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a gwyne to have you, too!" 
And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on. By-and-by a proudlooking man about fifty-five- and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town, too- steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and slow- he says: 
"I'm tired of this; but I'll endure it till one o'clock. Till one o'clock, mind- no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once, after that time, you can't travel so far but I will find you."
