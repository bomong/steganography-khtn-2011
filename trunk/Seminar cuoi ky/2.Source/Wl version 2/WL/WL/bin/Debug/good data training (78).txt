The king sassed back, as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into me again. He give me down the banks for not coming and telling him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way- said any fool would a knowed something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed himself a while; and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again. So they went off a jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd worked it all off onto the niggers and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it. 
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT 
By-and-by it was getting-up time; so I come down the ladder and started for down stairs, but as I come to the girls' room, the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd been packing things in it- getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now, with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there, and says: 
"Miss Mary Jane, you can't abear to see people in trouble, and I can't- most always. Tell me about it." 
So she done it. And it was the niggers- I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn't know how she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no more- and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says: 
"Oh, dear, to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more!" 
"But they will- and inside of two weeks- and I know it!" says I. 
Laws, it was out before I could think!- and before I could budge, she throws her arms around my neck, and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again! 
I see I had spoke too sudden, and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited, and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place, is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better, and actuly safer, than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I'm agoing to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says: 
"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways, where you could go and stay three or four days?" 
"Yes- Mr. Lathrop's. Why?" 
"Never mind why, yet. If I tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again- inside of two weeks- here in this house- and prove how I know it- will you go to Mr. Lathrop's and stay four days?" 
"Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!" 
"All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of you than just your word- I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible." She smiled, and reddened up very sweet, and I says, "If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door- and bolt it." 
Then I come back and set down again, and says: 
"Don't you holler. Just set still, and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all- they're a couple of frauds- regular dead-beats. There, now we're over the worst of it- you can stand the rest middling easy." 
It holted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself onto the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times- and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says: 
"The brute! Come- don't waste a minute- not a second- we'll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river! 
Says I: 
"Cert'nly. But do you mean, before you go to Mr. Lathrop's, or-" 
"Oh," she says, "what am I thinking about!" she says, and set right down again. "Don't mind what I said- please don't- you won't, now, will you?" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. "I never thought, I was so stirred up," she says; "now go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say, I'll do it."
