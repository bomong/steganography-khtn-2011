But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the washpan, afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account because they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag-rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if the rope-ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business, I don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and lay him enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too. 
Nat didn't look, when we put the witch-pie in Jim's pan; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and so soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope-ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole. 
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT 
Making them pens was a distressid-tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But we had to have it; Tom said we'd got to; there warn't no case of a state priosner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms. 
"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, spose it is considerable trouble?- what you going to do?- how you going to get around it? Jim's got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do." 
Jim says: 
"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arms; I hain't got nuffn but dish-yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat." 
"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different." 
"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he hain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't." 
"I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of this- because he's going out right, and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record." 
So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By-and-by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on. He says: 
"On the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister: and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it out of a book-means, the more haste, the less speed." 
"Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest of it mean?" 
"We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says, "we got to dig in like all git-out." 
"Well, anyway," I says, "what's some of it? What's a fess?" 
"A fess- a fess is- you don't need to know what a fess is. I'll show him how to make it when he gets to it." 
"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell a person. What's a bar sinister?" 
"Oh, I don't know. But he's got to have it. All the nobility does." 
That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn't do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make no difference. 
He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription- said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so: 
1. Here a captive heart busted. 
2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted out his sorrowful life. 
3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 
4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.
