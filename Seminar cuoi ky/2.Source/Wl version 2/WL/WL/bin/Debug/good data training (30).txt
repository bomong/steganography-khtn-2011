"But I don't want him killed, and I've got my reasons for it." 
"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you, long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering. 
Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail, and started towards where I was, there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could, about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good tune; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man come a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says: 
"Here- come in here." 
And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in, I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was, by the whisky they'd been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference, anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And besides, a body couldn't breathe, and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says: 
"He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him now, it wouldn't make no difference after the row, and the way we've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now you hear me. I'm for putting him out of his troubles." 
"So'm I," says Packard, very quiet. 
"Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all right. Le's go and do it." 
"Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's gotto be done. But what I say, is this; it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter, if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't that so?" 
"You bet it is. But how you goin'to manage it this time?" 
"Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gether up whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't agoin' to be more 'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that's a considerble sight better'n killin' of him. I'm unfavorable to killin'a man as long as you can git around it; it ain't good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?" 
"Yes- I reck'n you are. But s'pose she don't break up and wash off?" 
"Well, we can wait the two hours, anyway, and see, can't we?" 
"All right, then; come along." 
So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said in a kind of a coarse whisper, "Jim!" and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says: 
"Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck, there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fix- for the Sheriff'll get 'em. Quick- hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and-" 
"Oh, my lordy, lordy! Raf Dey ain' no raf' no mo', she done broke loose en gone!- 'en here we is!" 
Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd got to find that boat, now- had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too- seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further- so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left, he said. But I said come on, if we get left on this wreck, we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled, again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door, there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her; but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out, only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: 
"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!" 
He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself, and set down. It was Packard. Then Bill he come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice: 
"All ready- shove off!" 
I couldn't hardly hang onto the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says: 
"Hold on- 'd you go through him?" 
"No. Didn't you?" 
"No. So he's got his share o' the cash, yet."
