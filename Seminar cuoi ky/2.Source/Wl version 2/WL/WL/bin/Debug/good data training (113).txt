So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them, because they wore boots, and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots, and didn't yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us, we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making pow-wow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up steam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft, I says: 
"Now, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a slave no more." 
"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It 'uz planned beautiful, en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't nobody kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz." 
We was all as glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all, because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg. 
When me and Jim heard that, we didn't feel so brash as what we did before. It was hurting him considerble, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but he says: 
"Gimme the rags, I can do it myself. Don't stop, now; don't fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!- 'deed we did. I wish we'd a had the handling of Louis XVI, there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in his biography: no, sir, we'd a whooped him over the border-that's what we'd a done with him- and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps- man the sweeps!" 
But me and Jim was consulting- and thinking. And after we'd thought a minute, I says: 
"Say it, Jim." 
So he says: 
"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz him dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one? Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You bet he wouldn't! Well, den, is Jim gwyne to say it? No, sah- I doan' budge a step out'n dis place, 'dout a doctor; not if it's forty year!" 
I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say- so it was all right, now, and I told Tom I was agoing for a doctor. He raised considerble row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind- but it didn't do no good. 
So when he see me getting the canoe ready, he says: 
"Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do, when you get to the village. Shut the door, and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres, in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the way they all do." 
So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming, till he was gone again.
CHAPTER FORTY-ONE 
The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man, when I got him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting, yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening, and surprise the folks. 
"Who is your folks?" he says. 
"The Phelpses, down yonder." 
"Oh," he says. And after a minute, he says: "How'd you say he got shot?" 
"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him." 
"Singular dream," he says. 
So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But when he see the canoe, he didn't like the look of her- said she was big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says: 
"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us, easy enough." 
"What three?" 
"Why me and Sid, and- and- the guns; that's what I mean." 
"Oh," he says.
