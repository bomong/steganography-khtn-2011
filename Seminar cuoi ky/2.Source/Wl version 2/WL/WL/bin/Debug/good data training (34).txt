"I don't know; but it's so. I got some of their jabber out of a book. Spose a man was to come to you and say 'Polly-voo-franzy'- what would you think?" 
"I wouldn't think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head. Dat is, if he warn't white. I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat." 
"Shucks, it ain't calling you anything. It's only saying do you know how to talk French." 
"Well, den, why couldn't he say it?" 
"Why, he is a-saying it. That's a Frenchman's way of saying it." 
"Well, it's a blame' ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout it. Dey ain' no sense in it." 
"Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?" 
"No, a cat don't." 
"Well, does a cow?" 
"No, a cow don't, nuther." 
"Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?" 
"No, dey don't." 
"It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?" 
"Course." 
"And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from us?" 
"Why, mos' sholy it is." 
"Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a Frenchman to talk different from us? You answer me that." 
"Is a cat a man, Huck?" 
"No." 
"Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. Is a cow a man?- er is a cow a cat?" 
"No, she ain't either of them." 
"Well, den, she ain' got no business to talk like either one or the yuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman a man?" 
"Well, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he talk like a man? You answer me dat!" 
I see it warn't no use wasting words- you can't learn a nigger to argue. So I quit. 
We judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble. 
Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a tow-head to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line, to make fast, there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me- and then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn't come. I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them. 
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down to the tow-head. That was all right as far as it went, but the tow-head warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man. 
Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank or a tow-head or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there, somewheres, I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come, I see I warn't heading for it but heading away to the right of it. And the next time, I was heading away to the left of it- and not gaining on it much, either, for I was flying around, this way and that and 'tother, but it was going straight ahead all the time. 
I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good, now. That was somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around. 
I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down stream and I was all right, if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog. 
The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the current was tearing by them so swift. 
In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still, then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.
