"No! A servant ain't nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs." 
"Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's week, and Fourth of July?" 
"Oh, just listen! A body could tell you hain't ever been to England, by that. Why, Hare-l- why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year's end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theatre, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres." 
"Nor church?" 
"Nor church." 
"But you always went to church." 
Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man's servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant, and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of it's being the law. But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn't satisfied. She says: 
"Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?" 
"Honest injun," says I. 
"None of it at all?" 
"None of it at all. Not a lie in it," says I. 
"Lay your hand on this book and say it." 
I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says: 
"Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll believe the rest." 
"What is it you won't believe, Joe?" says Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her. "It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be treated so?" 
"That's always your way, Maim- always sailing in to help somebody before they're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him. He's told some stretchers, I reckon; and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit and grain I did say. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can't he?" 
"I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big, he's here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it. If you was in his place, it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed." 
"Why, Maim, he said-" 
"It don't make no difference what he said- that ain't the thing. The thing is for you to treat him kind, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks." 
I says to myself, this is a girl that I'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money! 
Then Susan she waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb! 
Says I to myself, And this is another one that I'm letting him rob her of her money! 
Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again- which was her way- but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor Hare-lip. So she hollered. 
"All right, then," says the other girls, "you just ask his pardon." 
She done it, too. And she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again. 
I says to myself, this is another one that I'm letting him rob her of her money. And when she got through, they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down and mean, that I says to myself, My mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them or bust. 
So then I lit out- for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by myself, I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No- that won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No- I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help, I'd get mixed up in the business, before it was done with, I judge. No, there ain't no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it. They've got a good thing, here; and they ain't agoing to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it, and hide it; and by-and-by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it to-night, if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here, yet.
