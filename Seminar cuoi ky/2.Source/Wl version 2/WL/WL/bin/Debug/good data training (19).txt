I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't do me no good. By-and-by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm agoing to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better, right off. 
So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well onto an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I set down there on a log and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the tree-tops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck, somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire, away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight, now. Pretty soon he gapped, and stretched himself, and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says: 
"Hello, Jim!" and skipped out. 
He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says: 
"Doan' hurt me- don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I awluz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'." 
Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome, now. I told him I warn't afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says: 
"It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good." 
"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries." 
"Strawberries and such truck," I says. "Is that what you live on?" 
"I couldn' git nuffn else," he says. 
"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?" 
"I come heah de night arter you's killed." 
"Yes- indeedy." 
"What, all that time?" 
"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?" 
"No, sah- nuffn else." 
"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?" 
"I reckon I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan'?" 
"Since the night I got killed." 
"No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire." 
So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big cat-fish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him. 
When breakfast was ready, we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. 
By-and-by Jim says: 
"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty, ef it warn't you?" 
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says: 
"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?" 
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he says: 
"Maybe I better not tell." 
"Why, Jim?" 
"Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef I 'uz to tell you, would you, Huck?" 
"Blamed if I would, Jim." 
"Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. I- I run off." 
"But mind, you said you wouldn't tell- you know you said you wouldn't tell, Huck." 
"Well, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest injun I will. People would call me a low down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum- but that don't make no difference. I ain't agoing to tell, and I ain't agoing back there anyways. So now, le's know all about it."
