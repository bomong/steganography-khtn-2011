I dived- and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I staid under water a minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my arm-pits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her. 
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was "treading water," and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way. 
It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clum up the bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
In about half a minute somebody spoke out of a window, without putting his head out, and says: 
"Be done, boys! Who's there?" 
I says: 
"It's me." 
"Who's me?" 
"George Jackson, sir." 
"What do you want?" 
"I don't want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs won't let me." 
"What are you prowling around here this time of night, for- hey?" 
"I warn't prowling around, sir; I fell overboard off of the steamboat." 
"Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. 
What did you say your name was?" 
"George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy." 
"Look here; if you're telling the truth, you needn't be afraid- nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?" 
"No, sir, nobody." 
I heard the people stirring around in the house, now, and see a light. The man sung out: 
"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool- ain't you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places." 
"All ready." 
"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?" 
"No, sir- I never heard of them." 
"Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry- come mighty slow. If there's anybody with you, let him keep back- if he shows himself he'll be shot. Come along, now. Come slow; push the door open, yourself- just enough to squeeze in, d' you hear?" 
I didn't hurry, I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I took one slow step at a time, and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log door-steps, I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more, till somebody said, "There, that's enough- put your head in." I done it, but I judged they would take it off. 
The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute. Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more- all of them fine and handsome- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn't see right well. The old gentleman says: 
"There- I reckon it's all right. Come in." 
As soon as I was in, the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of range of the front windows- there warn't none on the side. They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, "Why he ain't a Shepherdson- no, there ain't any Shepherdson about him." Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by it- it was only to make sure. So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says: 
"Why bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry?" 
"True for you, Rachel- I forgot." 
So the old lady says:
