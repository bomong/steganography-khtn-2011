"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats. But never mind- let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good." 
And so he went on a mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a mighty nice old man. And always is. 
Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he ciphered it out, he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says: 
"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons, yet." 
She says: 
"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted 'm myself." 
"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine." 
She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count- anybody would. 
"I declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine!" she says. "Why, what in the world- plague take the things, I'll count 'm again." 
So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says: 
"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's ten, now!" and she looked hurry and bothered both. But Tom says: 
"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten." 
"You numskull, didn't you see me count 'm?" 
"I know, but-" 
"Well, I'll count 'm again." 
So I smouched one, and they come out nine same as the other time. Well, she was in a tearing way- just trembling all over, she was so mad. But she counted and counted, till she got that addled she'd start to count-in the basket for a spoon, sometimes; and so, three times they come out right and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner, she'd skin us. So we had the odd spoon; and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was a giving us our sailing-orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle-nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said now she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right, if she did; and said that after she'd about counted her head off, for the next three days, he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more. 
So we put the sheet back on the line, that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again, for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had, any more, and said she didn't care, and warn't agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life, she druther die first. 
So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would blow over by-and-by. 
But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three washpans full of flour, before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last; which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim, the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings, and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope, that you could a hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it. 
And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go in the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies, if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole dinner.
