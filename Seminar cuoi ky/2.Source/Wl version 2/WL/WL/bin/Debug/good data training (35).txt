I just give up, then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down 'tother side of it. It warn't no tow-head, that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six mile long and more than a half a mile wide. 
I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five mile an hour; but you don't ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by, you don't think to yourself how fast you're going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way, by yourself, in the night, you try it once- you'll see. 
Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me, sometimes just a narrow channel between; and some that I couldn't see, I knowed was there, because I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn't long losing the whoops, down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much. 
I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively, four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing- it was floating a little faster than what I was. 
Well, I seemed to be in the open river again, by-and-by, but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it; so I thought I would take just one little cat-nap. 
But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first. First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things begun to come back to me, they seemed to come up dim out of last week. 
It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see, by the stars. I looked away down stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took out after it; but when I got to it warn't nothing but a couple of saw-logs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft. 
When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering oar. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time. 
I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and begun to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says: 
"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't you stir me up?" 
"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead- you ain'drownded- you's back again? It's too good for true, honey, it's too good for true. Lemme look at you, chile, lemme feel o' you. No, you ain' dead! you's back again, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck- de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!" 
"What's the matter with you, Jim? You been a drinking?" 
"Drinkin'? Has I ben a drinkin'? Has I had a chance to be a drinkin'?" 
"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?" 
"How does I talk wild?" 
"How? why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?" 
"Huck- Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. Hain't you ben gone away?" 
"Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain't been gone anywheres. Where would I go to?" 
"Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is. Is I me, or who is I? Is I heah, or whah is I? Now dat's what I wants to know?" 
"Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a tangle-headed old fool, Jim." 
"I is, is I? Well you answer me dis. Didn't you tote out de line in de canoe, fer to make fas' to de tow-head?" 
"No, I didn't. What tow-head? I hain't seen no tow-head." 
"You hain't seen no tow-head? Looky here- didn't de line pull loose en de raf' go a hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?" 
"What fog?"
